It is widely believed that climate change will be the next pandemic, and although it is understood and we have already started to see some of the effects, it is still largely ignored by the majority of the people and the companies. How do we bring about this change? There are many answers out there, many alternatives to the toxic products, but the base of finding all these answers is analyzing and prediction. There are way too many parameters that affect the environment, we hear about Carbon Dioxide to responsible for Air pollution but there are more gases that affect like Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide to name a few. This is why when introducing any solution attempting to tackle any problem, it is essential to analyze the conditions before and after and comparing. In this project, we will be seeing how different parameters in the air affect the air pollution using Machine Learning Algorithms. We will be concentrating on how Carbon Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitroger Dioxide etc. We are going to take data from last five years from various cities in India. As mentioned before, there are many other factors involved. Humidity means the air has more water and is more denser so the harmful chemicals are more contained in the air too, but because of humidity there isn't an extreme change in the temperature too. Air pollution changes seasonly too. Cold air is more denser than hot air and thus the harmful chemicals don't move around a lot and is consumed more. Thus, the air pollution is much higher in winters than in summers. This is why, taking data from multiple years is necessary for a proper model. In this project, we are analyzing the air pollution qulity index in 5 cities namely Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata.
